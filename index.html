            At Paws in Heaven, your local pet cremation service provider, we
            understand how difficult it is to lose a pet. We use our compassion
            and expertise in memorializing pets and final disposition to make
            your bereavement a bit easier.

          <h2>Services</h2>
          <p>
            Paws in Heaven offers private (individual) and communal cremation
            options. In private cremation—where your pet’s ashes are returned to
            you in an engravable urn—we place your pet in a private cradle with
            an identifying metal tag. We also offer communal cremation, where
            your pet is cremated in a shared receptacle and their ashes are
            spread on our farmland alongside those of other pets. With communal
            cremation, you will receive an ink print of your pet’s paw to
            commemorate their life and time spent with you.
          </p>
          <p class="highlight">
            No matter the services you choose, your pet will be treated with the
            same gentle care we would give our own.

          <div class="xyz">
          <p>
            Aquamation is a gentle, eco-friendly, water-based cremation of your
            pet’s remains. It uses water flow, warm temperatures, and an
            alkaline solution to mirror the natural process when a pet is laid
            to rest in the soil.
